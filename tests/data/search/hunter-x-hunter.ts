            Synopsis:
                "Fumizuki Academy isn't a typical Japanese high school. This unique institution has implemented a new and innovative system to sort its students. At the end of their freshman year, students take a test that divides up the student body. The highest scorers are placed into A class, all the way down until F class, for the lowest of the low.\n\nUnfortunately for Akihisa Yoshii, his supposedly \"great\" intellect wasn't quite enough for such a test, and he's now stuck at the bottom of F class. Naturally, F class has the worst facilities: not only rotten tatami mats and broken tables, but also outdated equipment and worn out furniture. On the bright side, his friend Yuuji Sakamoto is in the same class, and to everyone's surprise, the genius girl Mizuki Himeji has also ended up in the same class due to an unforeseen fever on the day of the test.\n\nUnsatisfied with their perquisites, F class rallies behind Yuuji, determined to take on the higher-tiered classes in order to seize their perks by using the school's Examinations Summon Battle system. The participants can summon fantasy characters—whose power levels are equal to their student's test scores—in an all-out battle. Will F class be able to rise to the top, or will they live up to everyone's expectations and fail?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

                'In a world plagued by magical dangers and threats, there exist special warriors—known as Inquisitors—who are tasked with non-violently preventing these threats and nefarious actions. The Anti-Magic Academy is a specialized school built to educate and train these Inquisitors, which splits its students into small squads in order to train them to work together. Among these talented squads is the 35th Test Platoon, also known as the "Small Fry Platoon" due to its low ranking and incompetent members. \n\nHowever, everything changes when Ouka Ootori, a powerful yet rebellious former Inquisitor, is forced into joining due to her tendency to break rules and committing a serious violation: the killing of a witch. Tempers flare upon her arrival, as she clashes with their clumsy captain Takeru Kusanagi and argues with the rest of the squad over her views on witches. This eclectic group has a long way to go if they wish to succeed and climb the ranks at the Anti-Magic Academy: they must first set aside their differences and come to work together as a team.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]',

After an intense back and forth from both sides, the fate of Seishun's advancement in the competition rests on the shoulders of their team captain.

Prior to the match, Inui proposes to Kaidou that they team up in order to elevate their playstyle and go beyond what they are currently capable of. Meanwhile, Shishido, who had just managed to get back onto the regular team, is resolved to prove that he deserves his position and must win no matter the cost.\n\nKnown as Seishun's \"Golden Pair,\" Eiji Kikumaru and Shuichiro Oishi face off against Rikkai University-Affiliated Middle School's Masaharu Niou and Hiroshi Yagyuu at the Kanto Regional Finals. While the game starts off smoothly for Seishun, Niou and Yagyuu begin to employ various strategies that make the game progressively harder to win. As the Golden Pair struggle against their opponents, the history behind the duo begins to unfold.\n\nFuji vs. Kirihara\nIn the Singles 2 event at the Kanto Regional finals, Seishun's \"Genius\" Shuusuke Fuji contends with Rikkai's second-year ace Akaya Kirihara. Kirihara boldly declares he will win the match within 13 minutes, a statement which Fuji cannot help but scoff at. As the match begins to draw out longer than anticipated, Kirihara resorts to a more violent playstyle. Backed into a corner, Fuji must quickly adapt if he wants to claim victory over Kirihara.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
